## About Me
Hi!
I'm a computer engineering student passionate about tech and engineering.
While I enjoy learning and developing technical skills, I'm most excited about building *<u>cool things</u>*.
Right now I'm working on autonomous driving algorithms.
Previously I worked on reprogrammable computer hardware (FPGAs) and computer vision.

In my free time, I enjoy pushing myself to new limits as an avid long distance runner and amateur triathlete.

I'm always open to collaborating with others, so feel free to get in touch!

*Fun fact: I don't like chocolate ice cream but I like chocolate dipped vanilla ice cream.
I enjoy chocolate chip cookies but I hate chocolate fudge cookies.
Chocolate brownies are very much my cup of tea, but chocolate cakes are another story!*
